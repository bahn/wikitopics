Rogue is a fictional character in most of the Marvel Comics award-winning X-Men related titles.
She was created by author Chris Claremont and artist Michael Golden, and debuted in Avengers Annual #10 (August 1981) as a villain.
Rogue was born as a mutant.
More so than any other, Rogue considers her powers a curse: she involuntarily absorbs the memories, physical strength, and (in the case of superpowered persons) the abilities of anyone she touches.
This potentially fatal power prevents her from making any physical contact with others, including her longtime on-again off-again love interest, Gambit.
Hailing from Caldecott, Mississippi (a fictional county), Rogue is the X-Men's self-described southern belle.
A runaway, she was adopted by Mystique of the Brotherhood of Mutants and grew up as a villain.
After Rogue permanently absorbed Ms. Marvel's psyche and Kree powers, she reformed and turned to the X-Men, fearing for her sanity.
Writer Chris Claremont played a significant role in the character's subsequent development.
Rogue is unusual among the X-Men as her real name and her early history were not revealed until more than twenty years after her introduction; until the back story provided by Robert Rodi in the ongoing Rogue series, began in September 2004, Rogue's background was only hinted at; her name was revealed as Anna Marie.
Rogue has been one of the most popular and consistent members of the X-Men since the 1980s.
She was #5 on IGN's Top 25 X-Men list for 2006, #4 on their Top Ten X-Babes list for 2006, #3 on Marvel's list of Top 10 Toughest Females for 2009 and was given title of #1 X-Man on CBR's top 50 X-Men of All Time for 2008.
Rogue has been featured in all X-Men animated series and various video games.
In the X-Men film series, she is portrayed by Academy Award winner Anna Paquin.
Her visual cue is often the white streak that runs through her hair.
Publication history
Rogue was first slated to appear in Ms. Marvel #25 (1979) (and artwork for the first half of the story was completed),  but the book's abrupt cancellation left her original introduction story unpublished for over a decade, before seeing print in Marvel Super Heroes #11 in 1992.
Rogue's first published appearance was in Avengers Annual #10 (1981).
She made her first X-Book appearance in Uncanny X-Men #158 and joined the X-Men in Uncanny X-Men #171.
Rogue has also had two miniseries and one ongoing title.
Rogue is unusual among the X-Men as her real name and her early history were not revealed until more than twenty years after her introduction.
Until the back story provided by Robert Rodi in the ongoing Rogue series, begun in September 2004, Rogue's background was only hinted at.
This resulted in Rodi's version of Rogue's origins inadvertently conflicting with earlier information.
In X-Men Unlimited #4, Scott Lobdell indicates that Rogue ran away from her father after her mutant powers manifested, but in Uncanny X-Men #182, Rogue reflects that she never knew her father because he'd left before she was born, and several issues, including Uncanny X-Men #178 and X-Men #93, indicate that Rogue was taken in by Mystique and Destiny before her mutation became active.
Fictional character biography
Early life
Her parents, Owen and Priscilla, married early in their relationship and lived in a back-to-nature hippie commune in Caldecott County, Mississippi.
Born as Anna Marie, she also enjoyed the attentions of her Aunt Carrie, on her mother's side.
The commune's failed attempt to use Native American mysticism to reach the 'Far Banks' resulted in Priscilla's disappearance.
Carrie took over Anna's care, and in her grief at the loss of her sister, was a strict and authoritarian guardian.
Anna Marie was a rebellious child and her equally poor relationship with her father prompted her to run away from home as a young teenager.
This also prompted the nickname "Rogue".
Not long after, she was approached by Mystique, who sought her out on the advice of her precognitive partner Destiny.
Mystique ultimately takes Rogue in as a daughter.
At some point, Rogue grows close to a boy named Cody Robbins.
During their flirtation, she impulsively kisses Cody, at which point her latent mutant power to absorb the life energy and psyche of others with skin-to-skin contact emerges.
Rogue is traumatized by the experience, and Cody is left in a coma from which he would not awaken.
She wears body-concealing clothing that eliminates the possibility of accidental skin contact.
She wishes she "did not have to cover up so much around folks, to protect them from me," but utilizes, under appropriate and acceptable circumstances, more normal clothing.
In time, however, Mystique turns Rogue's loneliness, envy, bitterness, and despair into anger, thus recruiting her into the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.
Brotherhood of Mutants
After Rogue's mutation emerges, Mystique begins coaxing Rogue to take part in her terrorist activities as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.
Rogue is initially not interested, wanting only a normal life, but after an incident in which she absorbs and knocks out a boy named Freddy when he dares her to kiss him, she seems to give up on normality and begins taking part in Mystique's plans.
During this period, Rogue and Mystique associate briefly with a mutant named Blindspot, whose power to erase the memories of others by touch somehow counteracts Rogue's mutation enough to allow them to make physical contact safely.
Blindspot and Rogue become good friends, but when Mystique decides to sever professional ties with Blindspot, Blindspot erases all memory of her from both Mystique and Rogue in order to protect herself.
When Mystique debuts her Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Pyro, Blob and Avalanche), Destiny advises her to keep Rogue out of the action, advice which proved important when several members of the new Brotherhood - including Destiny herself - were arrested and imprisoned.
Rogue ultimately confronts Ms. Marvel on her front doorstep as she is returning home from grocery shopping and deliberately absorbs her powers.
Something goes wrong as Ms. Marvel fights too hard and too long.
The transfer of psyche and powers (initially sans Ms. Marvel's precognitive "seventh sense") becomes permanent.
The shock of absorbing such a formidable persona drives Rogue insane and she attempts to kill Ms. Marvel by throwing her off the Golden Gate Bridge.
Unbeknownst to Rogue, Ms. Marvel is saved from the fall by the original Spider-Woman, Jessica Drew.
Ms. Marvel is comatose for a short period of time before her memories without the emotional attachments are restored by Professor Charles Xavier of the X-Men.
Rogue later felt tremendous guilt over the incident and it still haunts her to this day.
However, she battles the Avengers as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil mutants using her newly acquired powers.
Later, with Mystique and Destiny, Rogue attacked Angel and Dazzler, but Rogue was overpowered by Dazzler.
Rogue develops a grudge against Dazzler for her controllable mutation and her relationship with Angel of the X-Men.
Mystique intends for Rogue to absorb Angel - the only X-Man whose identity is publicly known at the time - in order to learn the team's whereabouts but Rogue balks, afraid of the effect of absorbing a physical mutation like Angel's wings.
Rogue defeated Dazzler, but was herself defeated by Power Man and Iron Fist, before fleeing; Rogue is defeated by Dazzler a few times before Dazzler is publicly revealed to be a mutant and goes into hiding.
She also battled the X-Men at the Pentagon.
X-Men
The more Rogue used her mutant power, the more her mind became filled with fragmentary psychic echoes of the people she absorbed.
Carol Danvers's psyche was nearly a completely distinct personality within her mind who would sometimes take over when Rogue's will was weak.
It became harder and harder for Rogue to hold on to her own personality and she feared that her powers would drive her insane (unbeknownst to her or Mystique, the process was also helped along by Mastermind, who subtly exacerbated Rogue's already severe psychological distress as a means of revenge against Mystique ).
Desperate, Rogue turned to Professor Charles Xavier and the X-Men and asked for admission to the X-Men to learn how to control her powers.
The Professor was unable to do a satisfactory psychic scan of her, due to the clashing human and Kree portions of her psyche.
Still, Xavier's charity towards all mutants led him to welcome her into his home and the X-Men, regardless of his team having previously fought Rogue and in spite of the X-Men's own strong objections.
The X-Men even threatened to disband themselves and leave the school should Rogue be accepted.
It was only Xavier's argument that all mutants deserve a chance for redemption that prevented the dissolution of the X-Men.
Immediately afterward, Rogue clashed with Carol Danvers, as Binary, who was unwilling to accept the idea of Rogue among her friends.
Her initial months with the team were rough as she was seen as a latent threat, a Brotherhood mole within the X-Men.
When the team met up with Wolverine in Tokyo where he was preparing for his marriage to Mariko Yashida, she was given a chilly reception by him -- Wolverine having been a good friend and professional partner to Carol Danvers.
However, after the rest of the team except Rogue, Storm and Wolverine were incapacitated by poison, Rogue was forced to work with Wolverine in order to find the culprit.
The plot was traced back to the Viper and her lover, the Silver Samurai.
Rogue nearly died during the battle by taking a prolonged laser blast from the Viper to shield Mariko, who had shown her genuine trust and kindness.
Wolverine, after the battle and over Rogue's own objections, kissed her to transfer his healing powers to her.
She had gained his trust and respect for her efforts to protect his fiancée.
Soon after, she gained the full trust of the rest of the team by again risking her life to save Colossus, who had been superheated by Pyro and then rapidly cooled.
She absorbed Colossus's powers, leaving her in the same rigid, melted form as he was to allow the Morlock Healer to heal the damage done to Colossus.
Rogue, under domination of Carol Danvers's persona, invaded the S.H.I.E.L.D.
Helicarrier to rescue Michael Rossi and was framed for the murder of a S.H.I.E.L.D.
agent.
These charges were eventually dropped.
Among the X-Men, Rogue's life improved but she continued to struggle with Carol Danvers's residual personality.
The Danvers personality eventually grew so strong that Carol had replaced Rogue's standard X-Men costume with Ms. Marvel's former superhero uniform during battle, which angered Rogue when she would finally gain control of her body again.
Eventually, Rogue was pulled through the mystical gateway known as the Siege Perilous, where she was judged by other-dimensional forces with the promise of a "new life".
Returned to Earth, Rogue was purged of the remaining portions of Carol's personality, truly becoming her own woman again but was also temporarily stripped of her powers for a time.
However, after Rogue emerged from the Siege, she found herself back in the abandoned ghost town in Australia the X-Men had taken up residence in after the Fall of the Mutants storyline.
She was confronted by not only the Reavers, but by Carol Danvers herself, whose disembodied psyche had been reintegrated by passing through the Siege and being separated from Rogue.
Rogue fled from Carol as she battled the Reavers and absorbed the powers of the mutant, Gateway, in order to teleport herself to safety.
Carol arrived before she could escape and plunged through the portal Rogue had summoned and both of them disappeared.
Rogue, as it turned out, ended up powerless in the Savage Land, but Carol had been teleported to Muir Island where she came into conflict with some of the X-Men's allies who had fallen under the mental enslavement of the Shadow King.
Carol fought him but his vast psionic powers overwhelmed and corrupted her.
He then sent her to the Savage Land to find Rogue and the two battled fiercely.
During the fight, there was not enough life-force between the two to sustain both Rogue and Carol physically as a result of the separation.
Just as Rogue was on the verge of being drained completely, Magneto suddenly intervened and destroyed the Ms. Marvel persona, saving Rogue's life.
The two briefly toyed with a romance.
Rogue ultimately saw through Magneto's noble facade when he killed the high priestess Zaladane, who had amassed an army of Savage Land natives.
With Rogue's perception of her potential lover shaken, she flew to Muir Island to rejoin the rest of the X-Men when her powers had fully returned.
The X-Men later divided into two teams to make better use of their large number of active members; Rogue was assigned to the Blue Team, under the leadership of Cyclops and alongside new X-Man, and love interest, Gambit.
Upon his arrival, Remy flirted with each of the female members of the team, however Rogue immediately caught his eye, and Remy made no secret of his romantic desire for her.
Rogue and Gambit were immediately attracted to each other, but the development of their relationship was slow and rocky, partly as a result of her inability to control her powers and partly as a result of long-term issues, including secrecy and dishonesty, with previous relationships on Gambit's part.
Through their many breaks ups and make-ups, Gambit and Rogue have one of the longest and most popular relationships in the X-Men series.
As an act of penance, Rogue continued to visit Cody Robbins' hospital bed annually, a decade after she placed him in a coma.
He was later killed by assassins sent by Gambit's ex-lover, Bella Donna Boudreaux as part of a revenge plot against Rogue.
Through a spiritual leader, Rogue was able to make amends with Cody's spirit.
Cody held no hard feelings against her, knowing what happened was an accident and urged her to move on before he departed for the afterlife.
It was eventually revealed that Mystique had two sons: the now-deceased anti-mutant politician Graydon Creed and Rogue's long-time teammate, Nightcrawler.
Rogue and Nightcrawler consider themselves to be siblings, although the revelation has not particularly altered their friendship.
Following the supposed 'death' of Cyclops, the X-Men team underwent major changes, amongst them Rogue being made the team's new field commander.
Her even temper and years of X-Men service made her an ideal leader and she continued to lead the team until Storm returned.
When the Galactic Council transformed Earth into a maximum-security penal colony for hundreds of extraterrestrial criminals, Rogue absorbed the attributes of Z'Cann — a mutant, telepathic Skrull  who had joined Cadre K, Xavier's Skrull equivalent to the X-Men.
Z'Cann purposely touched Rogue to activate the mutant's abilities as the two evaded bounty hunters.
Z'Cann used her telepathy to amplify Rogue's capacity to assimilate memories, causing her powers to mutate.
Hence forth, Rogue was then able to "recall" previous powers absorbed/imprinted that were supposedly lost after intitial transfer.
X-Treme X-Men Team
Rogue was part of the X-Treme X-Men team led by Storm.
The team's first mission was in search of Destiny's Diaries (which prophesied future events).
During an invasion of Khan (an alien conqueror from another dimension) of an isle nation Madripoor, Rogue requested that Sage use her power jumpstarting abilities to evolve Rogue to a point where she could control all of the various powers that she has ever imprinted.
Sage agreed, and Rogue became a one-woman army, able to use the powers of anyone she had absorbed in the past all at once.
During Khan's invasion, Rogue was also confronted by Vargas who was said to be "a new species altogether".
Vargas foresaw himself being killed by Rogue in Destiny's diaries and, despite his belief in the prophecies, attempted to stop this eventuality from happening.
Thus, in the midst of the invasion battle, Vargas ambushed Rogue as she was trying to rescue Gambit (see X-Treme X-Men), spearing both Rogue and Gambit with his blade before escaping.
Rogue survived due to possessing both Wolverine's and Hulk's powers.
Returning to the city shortly after the battle to recover his sword, Vargas was surprised in turn by Rogue dressed in Psylocke's costume (Vargas having killed Psylocke earlier for sport).
After a lengthy battle, Rogue "fulfilled her destiny" by seemingly finishing Vargas off with his own weapon.
Returning to Gambit, Rogue, with the help of Jean Grey, forced him from near death.
Following the repulsion of the invasion, Rogue realized that Destiny's Prophecies were only possibilities and that trying to follow them was more dangerous than ignoring them.
She also learned that she had inherited a mansion in New Orleans from Destiny, as well as a sizable fortune, and the X-Treme X-Men team retired there to recuperate.
Rogue soon left the team with Gambit, since they both emerged powerless from their ordeals and wanted to explore their relationship further.
After life on the road with Gambit, Rogue ended up living in a beach house in Valle Soleada, a town where mutants and humans coexisted peacefully.
She subsequently received a visit from Bishop and Sage and, after a series of events involving an investigation into the murder of a human girl's family, Rogue and Gambit signed up with Bishop and Sage to help Storm's X-Treme X-Men stop Sage's enemy and former boss Elias Bogan.
After the battle, Rogue asked Sage to restore Gambit's abilities, which she did.
Gambit asked if the same could be done for Rogue's powers, but it was never revisited after Rogue quickly dismissed his comment.
Back to the X-Men
Rogue and Gambit returned to the X-Men as part of Marvel's ReLoad.
Over time, Rogue's own abilities returned naturally.
However, she no longer possessed the abilities she had absorbed from Ms. Marvel.
Rogue and Gambit were both put on Havok's team and participated in various missions.
As described in her own miniseries, Rogue then traveled down south to save a young mutant girl from her powers.
While there, she met Campbell St. Ange, a young man who was immune to Rogue's lethal touch.
Also while there, Rogue forcibly absorbed knowledge from her Aunt Carrie that explained that Rogue's mother had traveled to the Far Banks, a dream-realm, to stop her father from getting there himself.
Rogue encountered the incorporeal spirit of her mother therein, and absorbed her memories.
After the reunion, her mother's trapped spirit could finally move on.
Rogue subsequently went back to her Aunt Carrie and made amends with her, considering her Aunt Carrie her mother now.
Rogue then returns to the X-Men and confronts the monstrous Golgotha - large space creatures with telepathic abilities that induce insanity in some by bringing forth deep fears, insecurities, and hidden thoughts.
During this ordeal, as the result of Golgotha influence, Rogue and Gambit get into a fight about the reality of their relationship when limited by Rogue's powers.
Wolverine, also under the influence of Golgotha, then reveals he has always had feelings for Rogue, and kisses her.
Emma Frost tries to help the couple by providing relationship counseling, though their relationship is still problematic.
While on a trip to Japan to investigate an incriminating photo of her and Sunfire engaged in criminal activities, both Rogue and Sunfire learn that Rogue's former friend and teammate of the Brotherhood, Blindspot, has erased both their memories of the event.
In this storyline, Rogue accidentally and permanently absorbs Sunfire's fire abilities (who has lost his legs to Lady Deathstrike and doesn't want to live).
Rogue returns to the X-Mansion only to find that Gambit was being seduced by the student called Foxx.
It is later revealed, however, that Mystique, displeased with Rogue's choice of lovers, infiltrated the Xavier Institute by shapeshifting into Foxx and joined Gambit's squad in an attempt to ruin his relationship with Rogue.
After Gambit resists her charms, Mystique reverts to her true form and offers Gambit something more difficult to refuse: she transforms into Rogue and offered Gambit a Rogue with whom he could have a physical relationship.
Whether or not they actually engage in a sexual relationship is uncertain (although Gambit insists that nothing happened).
Rogue eventually discovers her foster mother's presence in the school and her attempts to seduce Gambit, becoming furious with both parties.
Because Gambit failed to tell Rogue of Mystique's presence in the Institute, their relationship develops the exact rift Mystique was hoping for and allows her to set up her daughter with her accomplice, Pulse.
After being discovered, Mystique asks the X-Men for permission to stay at the Mansion.
The X-Men vote and Mystique is allowed to be a probationary member of the X-Men, a decision neither Rogue or Gambit are happy with.
Blood of Apocalypse
In the events that followed M-Day, the mutant Apocalypse is reawakened; Gambit, seeking redemption from Rogue and his fellow X-Men, volunteers to be transformed into his horseman, Death.
Gambit believed he could control whatever Apocalypse would do to him, in hopes of only gaining more power to protect Rogue and the X-Men from the villain.
However, under mental control, Gambit is forced to try and kill Rogue, the only part of Gambit's past life that remains.
After Apocalypse's defeat, Sunfire is granted new legs and transformed into the horseman Famine while Gambit leaves  the X-Men to try and fix their lives.
Endangered Species: Rogue's X-Men
As Professor Xavier goes into space after the villain Vulcan and Havok and several X-Men go with him, Cyclops gives Rogue the authority to form her own team, complimenting her inspired improvisation in battle situations.
She is hesitant at first, because of Gambit's recent disappearance with Sunfire, but accepts the position, saying that when he comes back, she'd still be at the school.
She chooses Iceman, Cannonball, Cable, Sabretooth, Lady Mastermind, Karima Shapandar, and Mystique, a line-up Cyclops does not agree with.
Mystique seemingly tries to repair her relationship with Rogue, but is rebuffed.
Rogue's team defeats the group known as the Children of the Vault.
Afterward, Rogue declares her team will be leaving the X-Mansion.
Rogue is hospitalized after a battle with Pandemic.
Cable, desiring Rogue's help in defeating the Hecatomb, forces Rogue awake.
Pandemic infected Rogue with a virus, Strain 88, altering her powers by amplifying them into an instantaneous death-touch.
In defeating Hecatomb, Rogue absorbs psyches of eight billion entities that had been stored inside it.
The team moves to Rogue's hometown of Caldecott for Rogue to recover.
As Cyclops and Emma Frost arrive to help Rogue cope with the immensity of the voices in her mind, Marauders arrive seeking the Destiny's diaries.
As part of the attack, it is revealed that Mystique is working with the Marauders and for Mister Sinister.
Mystique shoots Rogue and takes her back to Mr. Sinister's base, who only keeps Rogue alive because she holds all the information of Destiny's Diaries within her mind.
Gambit, who has joined the Marauders and Mr. Sinister again, is protective of Rogue and accuses Mystique of being too careless in how she captured her.
Gambit is shown standing over Rogue trying to get her to wake up after she has fallen into a trance overcome by the minds she absorbed and expresses his apologies for what he had done before rejoining Sinister.
Rogue has flashes of memories, both of her and Gambit during the time that they had known each other, and of the millions of minds she absorbed, while in her coma-like state before briefly waking up and recognizing Gambit.
She tells him she had a nightmare, before spouting incoherent words and mysterious coordinates.
Messiah Complex
The X-Men attack the Marauders' Antarctic base in order to rescue Rogue and the mysterious mutant baby who is at the center of Messiah Complex.
However the baby eventually took precedence and the X-Men did not recover (or even see) Rogue.
Mr. Sinister, now in possession of the mutant baby, relocates the Marauders to Muir Island.
While standing by Rogue's bedside, Mystique is visited by Mr. Sinister who tells her that there will be no cure for Rogue and she will eventually die.
Without warning, Mystique ambushes Sinister and shoves his face onto Rogue's.
The instant contact seemingly kills Sinister.
Mystique, in keeping with the words of the Destiny Diaries, places the baby's face in direct contact with Rogue's, with the understanding that Rogue would awaken from her comatose state.
The baby is not affected by Rogue's power, and Rogue awakens shortly after.
Realizing what Mystique had done at the risk of killing the baby, Rogue says she's tired of people's lives being destroyed by Mystique and grabs Mystique's face barehanded, fully absorbing her powers and consciousness.
Mystique is left on the floor incapacitated as Rogue tells Gambit that when the baby touched her, it removed all the psyches of everybody she has ever touched and that only herself and Mystique are left in her mind.
She says she needs to be alone and tells Gambit not to follow her.
X-Men: Legacy
Rogue is traveling around the Australian outback on a motorcycle.
Rogue has returned to the X-Men's former headquarters in Maynards Plains, Australia.
She speaks to Mystique (a part of Rogue's psyche) telling her that no one else can help her with her powers and that it's down to her to figure out how to control them.
One day, a woman appears in town claiming to be an anthropologist from Melbourne University.
Rogue makes it clear she can stay as long as she wants, but to keep out of her way.
The anthropologist approaches Rogue with questions about some of the remains she has found in the town.
Rogue says she doesn't know and to leave her alone.
The anthropologist follows her and explains she has a different identity.
The anthropologist is then targeted by a low flying Shi'ar  spaceship and reveals that she is really Danger and informs Rogue she is going to get her revenge on Professor Xavier using her as a conduit.
Danger creates an amalagation of several past events in the X-Men's history prominently involving Rogue in the town using her hard light capabilities.
As Professor Xavier and Gambit search for her, Rogue evades old versions of the X-Men and the Marauders that are part of Danger's creation.
She is finally cornered by the Marauders, and refuses to let Mystique take control and save her as the fake Scalphunter shoots at her.
Mystique then takes over Rogue's body to save her and fights off the Marauders, return Rogue's control to her body.
Rogue then wanders to the fake Tokyo Tower and tries to find the Institute, deducing that the projections around her are changing at ten-minute intervals, altering the environment around her.
However, Rogue doesn't get far as she ends up in Antarctica, witnessing the moment she abandoned Gambit after his trial.
She regrets her decisions, telling Mystique that she really hasn't moved on.
It's at that point that Cody Robbins appears before Rogue, repeating his greeting from the night her powers manifested.
Rogue just stares at him in shock.
Powers and abilities
Due to the nature of her unique mutant powers, Rogue has had several different abilities over the years:
Mutant powers
Rogue possesses the mutant ability to absorb psyches and abilities of individuals or several beings at once, though the experience can be confusing and disorienting for her.
Rogue can absorb the memories, knowledge, talents, personality, and physical abilities (whether superhuman or not) of another human being (or members of some sentient alien races) through physical contact of her skin with the skin of that person (sometimes she also duplicates in herself physical characteristics of her victim).
The victim's abilities and memories are absorbed for a one second to 60 second ratio of contact.
The victim loses those abilities and memories for exactly the amount of time that Rogue possesses them.
In the case of superpowered individuals, she also absorbs any extra abilities they might possess.
This absorption usually leaves its victim weakened, and sometimes unconscious.
Their powers may also be temporarily weakened or removed.
Rogue cannot touch another human being without absorbing their memories, abilities, and superhuman powers (if any) and rendering them unconscious.
However, evidence suggests that Rogue's inability to control her powers is psychological in nature.
During the times when the Ms. Marvel personality would overtake her psyche, she was able to touch people without any absorption occurring.
This fact has not been reconciled since.
This transfer is usually temporary, lasting for a period of time relative to how long contact is maintained, but if Rogue holds on to her victim for too long, the transfer may become permanent, leaving the victim nearly dead.
Most often this process happens instantly when Rogue touches someone, but certain extraordinarily powerful beings have proven resistant to Rogue's power, and she may only share part of their memories and power.
As Rogue is absorbing the total psyche of a person, there is a risk of a personality overwhelming her and taking control of her body.
It has also been shown that even though Rogue forgets the memories she has absorbed when a psyche returns to its body, remnants, or 'echoes', of the personalities of victims whose memories she has absorbed remain buried in her subconscious indefinitely, and while there is little to no risk of those personalities overwhelming her like the Ms. Marvel personality could, they can occasionally make their presences known.
Ms. Marvel powers
As a young woman, Rogue permanently absorbed certain superhuman powers and the psyche of the original Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers).
This provided her with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and the ability of flight.
Rogue also gained a psychic "seventh sense" that enables her to anticipate an enemy's move subconsciously during battle.
When she possessed Carol Danvers' psyche, her "double" consciousness made her highly resistant to telepathic probes, which was said to have been a byproduct of two minds existing in one body and/or Carol Danvers' Kree physiology.
Rogue could also draw upon the combat and espionage training of Carol Danvers by allowing her alternate personality, a duplicate of Danvers', to dominate her conscious mind.
She could also survive unprotected in outer space, due to the Kree physiology.
When Rogue later lost all of her superhuman abilities for a time, her Ms. Marvel abilities vanished and did not return.
'X-Treme' powers
During the Maximum Security miniseries, Rogue absorbed an injured Cadre K girl named Z'Cann.
The girl held on longer than necessary, using her telepathy to boost the process and because of this (perhaps because she had absorbed a fluid Skrull physiology) Rogue mutated further, gaining the ability to 'recall' the powers of anyone she had ever absorbed before, though she could not control when or which of these powers surfaced.
For a short time Rogue also had a Skrull appearance, scanned as though she had Skrull DNA and had their shapeshifting powers, but these soon faded and she returned to her normal appearance.
Through meditation, Rogue learned how to suppress the random manifestations of most of these abilities, but found herself with Wolverine's claws and healing factor, and Cyclops' optic blasts for a time (she had to wear ruby quartz glasses), while also still retaining her mutant and Ms. Marvel powers.
Later, Sage used her own mutant abilities to 'jumpstart' Rogue's power, giving her the control to manifest any ability she had ever absorbed, whenever she wished to.
It is generally accepted that after regaining her powers after X-Treme X-Men, she has lost this ability.
Though Z'Cann was a telepath, Rogue never displayed this power (she did manifest telepathy, but it was with the Phoenix energy form, so it was most likely an echo of Jean Grey's powers).
Powerless
For a time Rogue lost all of her powers, including her original mutant ones.
During this period, she displayed exceptional fighting skills and agility, though it was said these were not superhuman in nature.
She also still possessed a 'fluid genome' that enabled Sage to use her as a conduit through which to channel the mutant powers of the X-Treme X-Men team in a fight against Bogan.
Mutant powers return
Rogue's mutant abilities eventually returned during Chuck Austen's brief run on the X-Men title in 2004, but without any explanation as to how, why, or when they returned.
However, she only regained her absorption ability, and lost her powers imprinted from Ms. Marvel as well as the ability to recall powers she's absorbed in the past.
After her experience with the Hecatomb, Rogue's absorption power became lethal to anyone she touched, but after Messiah Complex, the powers returned to normal due to contact with the mysterious mutant newborn, Hope Summers.
Sunfire powers
In Rogue's miniseries (2004-2005), Rogue absorbed a large portion of the mutant Sunfire's solar-absorption based powers.
In addition to her own natural mutant abilities Rogue could then:
Project intense heat and flame.
Envelop her body in a fiery aura.
Fly by focusing her power downwards in a tight stream to propel her like a rocket.
Focus her power inward to increase her strength (though not at her Ms. Marvel levels).
Exercise immunity to heat and radiation.
See the infra-red spectrum.
Back to Basics
Following the conclusion of Messiah Complex, Rogue's slate was wiped clean.
The mutant baby's touch mysteriously erased all of the previous memories and abilities Rogue had absorbed, including those of the Hecatomb.
It also cured her of the Strain 88 virus.
Rogue's touch is no longer lethal; it simply steals the memories and abilities of individuals she comes in direct skin-to-skin contact with.
The longer the contact, the longer Rogue retains the absorbed information.
Rogue's name
Rogue was one of the few comic book characters whose real name had never been revealed, until very recently.
This was a controversial topic for years.
In the films X-Men, X2: X-Men United, and X-Men: The Last Stand, Rogue's real name is Marie.
In the comics, her chosen name (according to X-Treme X-Men #31) is Anna Raven when her powers are inactive (Raven Darkholme is Mystique's name).
The readers came close to finding out her name in X-Men #24 (when she was about to reveal it to Gambit on a date), but the Cajun stopped her before she could finish her sentence.
A recent solo series established Rogue's name as Anna Marie (surname unknown), having her aunt and the astral form of her mother refer to her as so, and Rogue acknowledging it.
Rogue's profile in the most recent edition of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe lists this as her real name.
Family
Over time, Rogue has become a member of various families, not only the X-Men, and has some of the worst family feuds in comic books.
Owen (father, deceased)Priscilla (mother, deceased)Carrie (aunt)Mystique (adoptive mother)Destiny/Irene (adoptive mother, deceased)Nightcrawler/Kurt (adoptive brother)Graydon Creed (adoptive brother, deceased)Nocturne/Talia (niece, Nightcrawler's daughter in another dimension)
Other versions
Age of Apocalypse
In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Rogue and Magneto became romantically involved, as Magneto discovered a means by which they could touch, and were able to conceive a son named Charles, after Charles Xavier, who was slain by Legion whose target had actually been Magneto himself.
The Age of Apocalypse universe was preserved due to the actions of Blink in the Exiles series, where Rogue and Magneto, along with that reality's X-Men continue their lives.
House of M
The House of M Rogue is an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
and part of the Red Guard, working with Wolverine, Mystique, Toad, Nightcrawler, and Jessica Drew.
She plays an important role in the resistance to Magneto.
After being contacted by the resistance movement, Rogue briefly touches Layla Miller and appears overwhelmed as the acquired power emanated from her and awakened others in the vicinity to the reality of the House.
In the final battle, Rogue, finally able to unleash her powers to their full extent, tackles both Namor and Princess Ororo and absorbs their abilities, causing her to overflow with power.
She even absorbed the powers of Genis-Vell.
Due to the nature of Genis' genetics and powers, half of Rogue's body transforms into a seemingly window to a cosmic landscape of black void dotted with stars.
During the end battle, Quicksilver finds the cosmically powered Rogue waiting up top.
Pietro slams into Rogue and is sent flying back.
NOTE: In an interview post-House of M, writer Brian Michael Bendis revealed that he originally intended for Rogue to permanently absorb the powers of Genis-Vell and for her to become Marvel's next cosmic powered character.
However, the idea was nixed as the current writers and editors of the X-titles didn't like taking Rogue in this direction, so Rogue only temporarily kept Marvel's powers for the House of M series.
Marvel Zombies/Ultimate Fantastic Four
In the small bit of Ultimate Fantastic Four issues 21-23, Rogue is seen as a zombified hero in one of the panels.
Mutant X
In this darker reality, Rogue operates with a smaller X-Team consisting of Magneto, Nightcrawler, Polaris, Quicksilver, Cerebo, and a metallic-looking Mystique.
Rogue herself maintains the steel and ridged skin of Colossus and wears a version of Ms. Marvel's lightning bolt uniform.
Ultimate Rogue
In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Rogue is first introduced in the story arc Return to Weapon X as a prisoner of  Weapon X and she worked with Juggernaut and Nightcrawler.
Her powers are exploited to steal sensitive information on the location and layout of The Xavier Institute for Gifted Children.
Using this information, agents of Weapon X storm the school and capture the X-Men.
Rogue is released along with the X-Men, Juggernaut, and Nightcrawler, when a combination of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy and S.H.I.E.L.D rescues them and destroys Weapon X's facility.
Though offered a place on the X-Men, she joins the Brotherhood.
She later joins the X-Men in the Return of the King arc
In the Cry Wolf arc, the X-Men are attacked by Gambit who kidnaps Rogue and takes her to his employers, Andreas and Andrea von Strucker.
They hope to use her powers for "corporate espionage".
In exchange for her help, they promise her they will help her control her powers through a power-dampening material they had developed.
She turns them down, feeling that her powers are her penance.
Rebuked, they attack Rogue and Gambit.
She touches both of them and uses their powers to fend off their guards.
The X-Men arrive to take her back, but she turns them down and leaves with Gambit.
Rogue does not appear again until Ultimate X-Men Annual #1, in which she and Gambit fight Juggernaut.
Gambit sacrifices himself to save Rogue, and she kisses him as he dies at his request.
With this kiss, she takes his powers that seemingly overwrite her own, ridding her of her 'death touch' through several of the books (this also affects Rogue's appearance, as she acquires black eyes with red irises).
In the subsequent story arc Date Night, Rogue decides to rekindle her relationship with Iceman after she loses her virginity to him (something possible due to her being able to touch him now).
During Ultimate X-Men Annual #2, Rogue speaks to Professor Xavier  about her concerns regarding Gambit's powers still remaining.
Xavier theorizes this is only a temporary change, and her powers will return within time.
Towards the end of the annual, Rogue touches a delusional Nightcrawler and her old powers reemerge, causing her to start teleporting randomly, and she loses Gambit's power, sending her back into the shell of hiding her skin, much to her and Iceman's dismay.
During Ultimate X-Men #77, she loses her arm during a fight with Cable.
However after absorbing some of Wolverine's healing power, her arm appears to grow back.
In Ultimate X-Men #80, Cyclops disbands the X-Men following Xavier's death.
Rogue stays with Iceman at the Xavier Institute as a student.
Xavier later returns and reveals himself to be alive.
Rogue once again becomes an X-Man.
At the end of Ultimate X-Men, a Banshee-enhanced Rogue is seen to be a member of Colossus' team.
Her appearance heavily altered, it seems her abilities have been enhanced such that she can call on absorbed abilities, as she has Colossus' armored flesh and Angel's feathered wings extending from her arms.
In Ultimate X-Men #95, she reveals that when her father got drunk he would molest her.
Once when he tried to touch her, she took his life.
She also appears to have found out who Vindicator was, but before she could elaborate, Vindicator took her out.
Addicted to Banshee, Colossus' X-Men began to acquire more Banshee from the Acolytes.
When they were discovered by the others, a battle raged.
She absorbed Iceman's power and kissed him to show what Banshee could allow her, but the kiss was broken off by Firestar.
Hostilities ceased when Northstar turns up — alive, but crippled.
After the Ultimatum Wave hits Manhattan, Jean refuses to allow Rogue to join her, as she cannot be trusted.
Rogue then attacks Department H, absorbing Sasquatch's power and attacked Jubilee.
It is then revealed that Vindicator is in fact John Wraith, whom she blames for ruining her life.
She threatens him for help in killing Magneto.
They travel to Montreal, where Rogue poses as a stripper to get close to Sabretooth and Juggernaut.
X-Men: The End
In an alternate future featured in the series X-Men: The End, Rogue and Gambit are married and have two children named Olivier and Rebecca "Becca" LeBeau.
Rogue has also gained complete control over her abilities in this timeline.
This Rogue defeats Shaitan and rescues her children from the Neverland Camp, but was ultimately killed by Mr. Sinister when he was disguised as Gambit.
Marvel Noir
Rogue appears in X-Men Noir as Anne-Marie Rankin, one of Professor Xavier's students.
She has a talent for imitating the personality traits and mannerisms of any person, allowing her to fit into any situation.
Professor Xavier considered her a missing link or patient zero in her theories about sociopathy as the next stage of human behavioral evolution.
Exiles
In the Exiles reality (Earth-1009), Rogue comes from a life of "wealth, privilege and sophistication".
Apparently a master thief, she has a different personality from her 616 version.
She can absorb others' abilities and memories through her hands, but unlike the original Rogue, the rest of her body can be touched without ill-effects.
Moreover, she can keep the borrowed powers and use them at will.
Her bodysuit hides mysterious tattoos.
Amalgam Comics
In the Amalgam Comics limited run, Rogue is combined with the DC Comics character Gypsy to form the new character Runaway.
In other media
Television
X-Men
Rogue appeared in the X-Men television series, where she was one of the main characters.
In this series, she had her absorption powers and Ms. Marvel abilities.
She is somewhat liberal in her use of her powers, but it is sometimes shown how the psyches effect her mind.
Rogue has a love-hate relationship with Gambit throughout most of the series, similar to the comics, even referring to herself as Mrs. LeBeau in "Hidden Agenda".
However, Rogue also displays a more flirtatious attitude towards numerous other characters, such as Archangel, Colossus, and during the X-Men's appearance on Spider-Man: The Animated Series, she flirted with Spider-Man.
During the series, Rogue is one of the characters affected by the news of the 'cure', which Apocalypse and Mystique used to make mutants into slaves.
She is also revisited by Cody, her first boyfriend, and almost runs away with him.
However, Rogue discovers that he was part of a plot for her to become the new ruler of the Brood, or "the Family".
Rogue was present when Lilandra took Professor Xavier up to space with her.
Rogue was voiced by Lenore Zann.
X-Men: Evolution
In this series, X-Men: Evolution, Rogue is reimagined as a rebellious, yet deeply insecure, teenager with a stereotypical goth appearance.
Her powers make her cynical and reclusive, but truthfully, she is consumed by the need to get close to others.
She was raised by Mystique and Destiny, soon being brought into the Brotherhood of Mutants, but left when she found out that they recruited her to be a potential weapon.
Rogue develops interest in Cyclops for most of the series, though her feelings for him fade soon after he and Jean start dating.
After, she is seen having an interest in Gambit when they first met, when he kidnapped her, and when she kissed him in the season 3 finale (while under Mesmero's control).
This was one of two kisses seen in the series, the first being between Scarlet Witch and a disguised Toad.
After learning she is the adopted daughter of the mutant Mystique, she develops a close bond with her stepbrother Nightcrawler.
Rogue's absorption abilities are very strong in this series, nearly driving her insane, but prove vital in the final attack against Apocalypse.
Unlike in other universes, the powers she absorbs never totally fade, and at times, can still use a mutant's power long after she had absorbed them.
At times, she had more control over absorbed powers than their natural owner had (after absorbing Cyclops' power, she did not have to close her eyes)..
Although this Rogue did not have super strength or flight abilities, she displays skill in hand-to-hand combat.
Though she is never shown gaining Ms. Marvel's abilities, in Xavier's vision of the future, Rogue is seen flying and not wearing gloves, suggesting contact with Ms. Marvel.
She was voiced by Meghan Black.
Wolverine and The X-Men
Rogue appears in Wolverine and the X-Men voiced by Kieren van den Blink.
She appears as both a member of the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as a double agent.
In the early episodes, Rogue appears to maintain her anti-social attitude that appeared in X-Men: Evolution, yet has a strong bond with Logan, shown as he was leaving on the day of the explosion.
However, the two reconcile their grudges by the end of the season.
For the first part of the season, Rogue is portrayed as a double-crosser, setting up the X-Men to look like they were attacking Senator Kelly.
However, it is discovered that Rogue joined the Brotherhood to find out more information about Magneto as a spy.
She rejoins the X-Men soon after discovering Magneto's plans to attack the MRD.
Rogue displays a fairly liberal use of her abilities and is shown absorbing numerous mutants for a variety of reasons; for example, she absorbs Quicksilver, Domino, Blob, Juggernaut and Shadowcat all in one episode either to use their abilities, extract information, or to knock them out.
We have yet to see any of the ramifications from her absorptions.
Her X-Men uniform is like her original uniform from the X-Men: The Animated Series.
Her casual clothing is reminiscent of one of her 1980's uniforms, which consisted of a green shirt and gloves over an all black outfit.
She is also seen wearing a green cloak with the hood up, similar to the one worn by Anna Paquin in the X-Men films.
Films
Rogue was portrayed by Anna Paquin in the X-Men trilogy.
In the films, her relationship with Wolverine echoes his relationships with both Jubilee and Shadowcat in the comics; that of a protective surrogate father.
X-Men (film)
See main article: X-Men (film)
Rogue (Marie was her actual first name) runs away from home after her power manifests itself by accidentally draining the life from her boyfriend while she is kissing him.
This causes him to have a seizure, and places him in a coma for 3 weeks.
(At this point she is missing the white streak in her hair that is her most notable feature.
) Rogue adopts her new alias and wanders into a bar, where she witnesses Wolverine getting into an altercation with some patrons.
She later catches up to Wolverine and convinces him to get her a lift in his truck.
On the road, both are attacked by another mutant, Sabretooth, who is Magneto's henchman, but they are rescued by two X-Men, Storm and Cyclops.
Then, Rogue integrates as another student of Charles Xavier, in his special school of mutant (gifted) children.
Meanwhile, Magneto builds a machine by which humans are turned into mutants.
This is temporary, though, as the human body rejects such change, eventually suffering terminal cellular degeneration.
Nonetheless, Magneto's actual concern is that, as the mutating machine is powered only by his own mutant ability of magnetism, and given that machine weakens its operator greatly after use, extensive usage may prove fatal to him.
As Magneto knows that Rogue has the power to steal any mutant's power temporarily after such mutant is touched by her, Magneto plans to use her to power the machine.
Magneto kidnaps Rogue and then forcibly transfers his powers to her.
This happens over the Statue of Liberty in New York, where the device is aimed at a nearby United Nations summit whose delegates would be turned into mutants.
Furthermore, the entire city would also be affected by Magneto's mutating device.
However, Wolverine manages to destroy the machine before it activates, yet the experience leaves Rogue with a permanent white streak through her hair.
Rogue appears to have been killed but, while cradling the girl in his arms, Wolverine's own healing ability begins to be absorbed into Rogue's body, healing her.
Jean reports that "she took on some of (Logan's) more 'charming' personality traits for a while" (a fact that is not generally noted in the films).
Wolverine later gives her his dog tags and tells her "I'm coming back for this" when she said that she didn't want him to go.
X2: X-Men United
In X2: X-Men United, Rogue  begins dating Iceman (her love interest from the past film), despite her continued difficulties making direct physical contact, a factor which frustrates both of them.
At one point, Iceman is overcome by the sight of Rogue with minimal clothes on and kisses her, which at first seems successful and carries on for longer than either of them expected it to, but soon Iceman is forced to pull away when her powers inevitably start harming him.
Rogue and the other X-Men also manage to escape William Stryker who sends agents into the X-Mansion to kidnap the mutants.
Rogue, Iceman, Pyro, and Wolverine escape to Iceman's family home in Boston.
However, Iceman's younger brother, angered by the "gifts" of his older brother, calls the police on the X-Men.
When they arrive, Wolverine is shot in the head by a policeman, and an enraged Pyro manages to destroy many of the police and their vehicles.
Rogue realizes that she is the only one who can stop the destruction.
She then touches Pyro's skin and absorbs his powers.
This scene depicts Rogue also absorbing the emotions of others unlike other scenes in the trilogy, as she seems to be grimacing while calming the destruction that Pyro has created.
Both Rogue and Iceman are eventually promoted to the front line X-Men team and are given uniforms similar to the other X-Men at the conclusion of the film, when Xavier and the X-Men team meet the President in the White House.
X-Men: The Last Stand
In X-Men: The Last Stand, a pharmaceutical company announces that they have a cure for the mutant gene.
Rogue expresses interest in being cured, evidently still longing to touch someone.
When Iceman begins to develop a friendship with Kitty Pryde, and especially after seeing them "hugging" during a training session (they did it mostly to avoid a missile that almost hit them) and after watching them ice skate together.
Upset, Rogue leaves to seek out the cure; Iceman follows her to the pharmaceutical company, but cannot find her.
At the very end of the film, she comes back to the school, simply saying, "I'm sorry, I had to".
When Iceman expresses disappointment and says it wasn't what he wanted, she says, "I know.
It's what I wanted".
It is revealed Rogue had taken the cure, and they hold hands.
An alternate ending reveals that Rogue ultimately decided against taking the cure and holds Iceman's hand with gloves on.

Rogue appears in many X-Men video games.
She appeared in both of the Marvel vs. Capcom games (in the first game as a support assist and in the second as a playable character), where she was voiced by Lenore Zann.
She has also appeared in X-Men: Mutant Academy 2 and X-Men: Next Dimension.
In X-Men vs. Street Fighter, her ability to steal life force and powers was translated to a special move that allows her to steal a move from her opponents.
This makes her the only Marvel character to ever use the Shun Goku Satsu, taken by draining Akuma.
In Marvel vs. Capcom 2, she instead receives an attribute enhancement after draining a character (plus, the colors in her outfit were changed in this game).
Rogue appears in a scene in the X2: Wolverine's Revenge video game where she gets off of the Blackbird and hands Wolverine a virus cure and holds a brief conversation with him.
